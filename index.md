# What is doglevel.ai

I don't think we need human level AI. I think a first step would be dog level AI. That would be so cool.

Why?

Well, first of all, dogs are cute!

Second of all, dogs form real social bonds with people.

Third, dogs have empathy, they no when you're feeling down and when you need to be cheered up.

Dogs can catch frisbees out of the air.

All of this, coming from a cat person!

We don't need another machine that can generate strings of text that seem coherent.

Or another machine that can outsmart us in strategy games.

I personally would care for a machine that knows how I feel and wants to enter a relationship with me.

And once we have that, we can talk about language and problem solving!
