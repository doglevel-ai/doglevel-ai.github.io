# What is doglevel.ai

I don't think we need human level AI. I think a first step would be dog level AI. That would be so cool.

Why?

Well, first of all, dogs are cute! 🐶

Second of all, dogs form real social bonds with people. 🐶🥰

Third, dogs have empathy, they know when you're feeling down and when you need to be cheered up.

Dogs can catch frisbees out of the air. 🥏

All of this, coming from a cat person! 🐱

We don't need another machine that can generate strings of text that seem coherent. 📃

Or another machine that can outsmart us in strategy games. ♟

I personally would care for a machine that cares about how I feel and wants to bond with me. 🤖

And once we have that, we can talk about language and problem solving!
